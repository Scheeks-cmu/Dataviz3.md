## Original Data Visualization
* Fetal Mortality Rate, Pittsburgh vs. Peer Cities*

I first encountered this data visualization when I was conducting research to write a policy memo on *Racial Disparities in Maternal Morbidity and Mortality Among Black Women* in Pittsburgh. Throughout my research process, I saw the data written out in paragraph form with very few data visualizations to match. Of the sources containing the information, they often recycled the same few data visualizations because the majority derived from one large study conducted by Pittsburghâ€™s Gender Equity Commission which highlights the disparate chances for survival are for people of color in Pittsburgh, specifically for Black women. I chose this particular data visualization because I thought it would be useful to have alternatve visualizations that may highlight the data either in a more effective or simply different way than what is currently available.
