## Original Data Visualization
*Fetal Mortality Rate, Pittsburgh vs. Peer Cities*

[How Pittsburgh Fails Black Women in 6 Charts](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-20/how-pittsburgh-fails-black-women-in-6-charts)

I first encountered this data visualization when I was conducting research to write a policy memo on *Racial Disparities in Maternal Morbidity and Mortality Among Black Women in Pittsburgh* for a class asignment last semester. Throughout my research process, I saw the data reported in paragraph form with very few data visualizations within the articles. Of the sources containing the information, they often recycled the same few data visualizations because the majority derived from one large study conducted by Pittsburgh’s Gender Equity Commission, which highlights the disparate chances for survival for people of color in Pittsburgh, and more specifically for Black women. I chose this particular data visualization because I thought it would be useful to have alternatve visualization options that may highlight aspects of the data in a different way than what is currently available.

The critiquing process allowed me to deconstruct the various angles of the data visualization beyond the readability and aesthetic, which are often the first things I notice in a chart. I think the orginal visualization serves its purpose in illustrating that Black women  have the lowest fetal mortality rate of any other women demographic in Pittsburgh and comparable cities, but it could've been way more effective in portraying the depth and severity of the research-based statistics shown throughout the article. For example, the source mentions that "18 out of every 1,000 pregnancies for black women end in fetal death, compared to 9 in a 1,000 pregnancies for white women" (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-20/how-pittsburgh-fails-black-women-in-6-charts). Those are valuable numbers, yet the dataviz doesnt contain any figures, only a line chart with racial indicators. Additionally, I thought it would be important to highlight that Pittsburgh’s Black fetal mortality rate is higher than 94 percent of similar cities, so I used a text bubble in the second figure to focus in on this statistic. In both sketches, I attempted to highlight different perspectives of the data in such a way that was simple yet informative. My goal was not to completely alter the data, but rearrange and highlight any additional informational I thought would be important for viewers to know and understand, even if they had not already read the accompanying article.

## Feedback

- Can you tell me what you think this is?
- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
- Did you learn anything interesting from the feedback on your initial design?

Takeaways for Figure #1:  The graph is pretty straightforward. Neither of my interviewees were confused nor surprised by the data being that they are both Black women from the city of Pittsburgh. Both however were curious as to who represented “AMLON”, so perhaps I’ll define the racial groups based on the original study. Additionally, one of my interviewees was bothered by the question of whom do they think the intended audence is because they felt it could range from Pittsburghers, to policymakers, to your regular joe schmo. 

Takeaways for Figure #2: I had to explain the context of this figure as opposed to the first one. My poor penmanship and small writing impeded their understanding. The Pittsburgh label was misleading because they thought that only that particular dot was representing the city, so I could maybe distinguish the Pittsburgh indicators as a sub header. I should enlarge the “Worse” and “Better” so that viewers better understand the parameters of the line chart and what the left and right side of the center line means. They also said adding some color would liven up the graph to make it more visually appealing. One interviewee suggested that I reiterate the per 1000 pregnacies to further define the figures on the y-axis. Overall, they both believed the information was valuable and appreciated the text bubble highlighting the particular statistic regarding Black women.


## Final Data Visualization

In all honestly, I feel very defeated by both this assignment and this chart. I had visions for my data visualization that I don't feel I executed as effectively as possible. I attempted to chart each state's overall fetal mortality rate but had difficulty seperating it by race. I also attempted to label several of Pittsburgh's "comparable cities" as referred to in the original data visualization because I thought it would be helpful to see an illustration of where and which cities those actually are. I resorted to hyperlinking the actual orginal source of the study conducted by Pittsburgh’s Gender Equity Commission because I felt it would be the most comprehensive way to make all the data accesible within the realm of the chart. I decided to add the color purple to represent fertility and youthfulness considering the topic is infants, yet I didn't want too lighter of hues that understated the context. Overall, I wanted to illustrate not only Pittsburgh's fetal mortality rate in comparison to other cities, but I also wanted to specifically highlight the disparate rates of Black fetal mortality both locally and across the United States. The rates of Black maternal mortality and morbidity are consistenly higher than other race in the country and it's not talked about enough.
