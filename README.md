## Original Data Visualization
* Fetal Mortality Rate, Pittsburgh vs. Peer Cities*

I first encountered this data visualization when I was conducting research to write a policy memo on *Racial Disparities in Maternal Morbidity and Mortality Among Black Women* in Pittsburgh. Throughout my research process, I saw the data written out in paragraph form with very few data visualizations to match. Of the sources containing the information, they often recycled the same few data visualizations because the majority derived from one large study conducted by Pittsburgh’s Gender Equity Commission which highlights the disparate chances for survival are for people of color in Pittsburgh, specifically for Black women. I chose this particular data visualization because I thought it would be useful to have alternatve visualizations that may highlight the data either in a more effective or simply different way than what is currently available.

## Feedback

- Can you tell me what you think this is?
- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
- Did you learn anything interesting from the feedback on your initial design?

Takeaways for Figure #1:  The graph is pretty straightforward. Neither of my interviewees were confused nor surprised being that they are both Black women from the city of Pittsburgh. Both were curious as to who represented “AMLON”, so perhaps I’ll define the racial groups based on the original study. Both interviewees believe the intended audience is the general public. 

Takeaways for Figure #2: I had to explain the context of this figure as opposed to the first one. My poor penmanship and small writing impeded their understanding. The Pittsburgh label was misleading because they thought that only that particular dot was representing the city, so I could maybe distinguish the Pittsburgh indicators as a sub header. I should enlarge the “Worse” and “Better” so that viewers better understand the parameters. They also said adding some color would liven up the graph to make it more visually appealing. One interviewee suggested that I reiterate the per 1000 pregnacies to further define the figures on the y-axis.
